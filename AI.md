# AI.md â€“ Electron App Guidelines

## Purpose
Instructions for AI coding assistants to keep this Electron project secure and consistent.

---

## Rules
1. Keep **main process**, **renderer**, and **preload** code separated.
2. Store CSS in `.css` files and JS in `.js`/`.ts` files (no inline).
3. Organize folders: `main/`, `renderer/`, `preload/`, `assets/`, `config/`.
4. Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript (ES6+).
5. Limit JS/TS files to ~800 lines.
6. Enforce Electron security:
   - `contextIsolation: true`
   - No `nodeIntegration` in renderer
   - Use preload for safe APIs
7. Never hardcode secrets â€” use environment variables.
8. **Track all changes in `change_tracker/` directory:**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Before creating or updating release notes, always ask the user which version is being worked on
   - For each feature, bug fix, or significant change, update the appropriate release notes file
   - Use format: `change_tracker/Release_vX.Y.Z.md`
   - Include: issue description, solution, files changed (with line numbers), and impact
   - Organize by categories: Bug Fixes, Features, Technical Details, Breaking Changes
   - Update release notes as changes are made, not at release time

## Example

âœ… **BrowserWindow with security**

const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  webPreferences: {
    contextIsolation: true,
    preload: path.join(__dirname, "preload.js"),
  },
});
